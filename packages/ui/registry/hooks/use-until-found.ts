/**
 * Keeps a collapsed panel in the page and findable. Render the element with `hidden={!open}`
 * and the returned ref, which also sets `ref` when given. While closed it carries
 * `hidden="until-found"`, so its text is in the HTML for search engines and the browser's find
 * in page can reach it. When a search or a link to a text fragment matches inside, the browser
 * fires `beforematch` and `onFound` runs, so the owner opens it through its own state. Without
 * `onFound` the panel is plainly hidden.
 *
 * Browsers that do not know `until-found` treat it as plain `hidden`.
